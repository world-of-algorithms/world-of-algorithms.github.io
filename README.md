#### Competitve Programming, Randomized, Approximation algorithms & more!

### Overview

* Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and play an essential role in various fields such as engineering, natural sciences, economics, and many others. This course aims to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of algorithms and their practical applications in various domains.
* Through lectures and hands-on exercises, students will explore prominent algorithms in competitive programming, approximation algorithms, and randomized algorithms alongside others.
* The target audience for this course includes undergraduate students interested in learning algorithms. Basic programming knowledge in python is recommended, and some mathematical background is helpful.
* Upon completing this course, students will be able to conceptualize and apply algorithms in a compound setting.

### Prerequisites: 

* *ECS 020; (ECS 060 or ECS 036C or ECS 032B); (ECS 122A Recommended)*
