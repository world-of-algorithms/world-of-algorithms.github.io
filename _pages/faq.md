#### What are the prerequisites for this course?

The prerequisite for this course is either ECS 036C or ECS 032B or instructor consent. ECS 122A is recommended but it is not necessarily required. We do not assume that the class audience would have taken ECS 122A so we will teach the necessary concepts from scratch.

#### Is this course suitable for beginners in programming?

You do not need to be an advanced programmer or have a lot of experience doing competitive programming (or experience with randomized and approximation algorithms). However, basic knowledge of python is required, especially some knowledge of basic data structures.

#### I know C/C++ or some other language. Can I still manage?

Yes, we can definitely help you catch up to Python syntax if you need help. Python is very beginner friendly and has an easy to learn syntax, partially the reason we use it, and it should be fairly simple to get started with it.

#### How will the course be delivered? Will it be in-person or online? Will it be recorded?

The course will be delivered 2:10 PM - 3:00 PM MWF in-person at Young Hall 194. The lectures would be recorded, but only provided if you have a valid reason (even if the reason is that coming to class wastes time)

#### What programming languages will be used throughout the course?

Python!!

#### Will there be any textbooks required for this course?

No textbook is required. Everything needed would be taught in the class.

#### Are there any recommended resources for further learning?

Some fun-to-read resources will be shared along the course which would be optional but very interesting.

#### How will my progress be assessed and graded in this course? Is there a final exam? If so, what is its format and weightage?

Please refer to the section about Grades.

#### What should I do if I have technical difficulties or issues accessing course materials?

At any point during the course, please feel free to reach out to us for any questions/concerns/queries you may have.

#### How can I get help and clarification on course content or assignments?

Email, office hours, and piazza would be effective ways.

#### Will there be any group projects or collaborative work in this course?

The final project will be done in groups of 2 (most likely).

#### Are there any specific software or tools that I need to install for the course?

Nope! Anything that can run your code should be fine. You are not required, but using Latex or Markdown would be encouraged for homeworks.

#### Can I get feedback on my assignments and projects to help improve my understanding?

For sure! The best way to learn is to carefully understand oneâ€™s mistakes in order to not repeat them in the future. Feel free to reach out to us either outside class or during office hours for any additional feedback.

#### Are there any opportunities for extra credit or bonus assignments?

Please refer to the Grades section.

#### What are the attendance requirements for this course?

Attendace is not mandatory, but participation would be rewarded with some extra credit. Please have a look at the Grades section. Please note that the lectures would be recorded, but only provided if you have a valid reason to miss the class (even if the reason is that coming to class is a waste of time).

#### How can I stay updated with course announcements and important deadlines?

This website and the Canvas page should be sufficient.
