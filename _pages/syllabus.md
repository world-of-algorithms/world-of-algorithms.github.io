### Assessment and Grading

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

|Catagory|Points|
|:-:|:-:|
|Assignments|60|
|Final Assignment|20|
|Interactive Grading|20|
|Extra Credit|3|

</div>

* Homework assignment: will be a mixture of theory question along with coding questions. Majority of the grade can be expected to come from the coding.
     Programs will be non-trivial and will be tested against pre-determined test cases. (Some test cases may check the runtime of your solution) Submission will be done through gradescope.
     All homework assignments and Final assignments will be open notes & open books. The final assignment will intend to challenge students by testing their implementation against time constraints. 
* Final assignment: can be considered as a larger cumulative version of the homework assignments. It will be released early in the quarter and you will have 5-6 weeks to work on it.
* Interactive grading: is a opportunity to gain some points through 1:1 question and answer session with the instructor. Expect to set aside 20 mintes.
* Extra Credit: will come in the form of particiapation various forms. 
* To pass the course students will need to attain at least 70 points.
