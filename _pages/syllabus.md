### Assessment and Grading

* Approximately 6 Homework assignments (10 points each), 1 Final Assignment (larger cumulative homework assignment) (20 points),  1 interactive grading (20 points)
* To pass the course students will need to attain at least 70 points.
* All homework assignments and Final assignments will be open notes & open books. The final assignment will intend to challenge students by testing their implementation against time constraints.


### Topics

Note: This is a very rough outline of the course. We plan on covering three main sections of content: competitive programming techniques, approximation algorithms, and randomization algorithms. We will work with Professor Mitrovic to finalize the exact topics within each broader section based on his guidance. Below are the possible topics that we can pick from.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Division 1: Competitive Programming techniques (Coding aspect)-> We know that these are popular</span>**

* Prime, Sieve, Prime Factorisation
* Matrix Exponentiation
* Disjoint Set
* Sqrt Decomposition/MOâ€™s algo
* Fenwick Tree
* Segment Tree
* Lazy Propagation

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Division 2: Approximation Algorithms -> These are NP-Complete problems</span>**

* Packing problems: SET-PACKING, INDEPENDENT SET
* Covering problems: SET-COVER, VERTEX-COVER
* Constraint satisfaction problems: SAT, 3-SAT
* Sequencing problems: HAMILTONIAN-CYCLE, TSP
* Partitioning problems: 3D-MATCHING 3-COLOR
* Numerical problems: SUBSET-SUM, KNAPSACK.

**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Division 3: Randomized Algorithms</span>**

* Randomized QuickSort
* Monte Carlo algorithm
* Las Vegas algorithm
* Bloom filter
* Randomized rounding
* Skip list
* Genetic algorithm
