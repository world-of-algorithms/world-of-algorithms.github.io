|      Catagory       | Points |
| :-----------------: | :----: |
|     Assignments     |   60   |
|  Final Assignment   |   20   |
| Interactive Grading |   20   |
|    Extra Credit     |   3    |

- Homework assignment: will be a mixture of theory question along with coding questions. Majority of the grade can be expected to come from the coding.
  Programs will be non-trivial and will be tested against pre-determined test cases. (Some test cases may check the runtime of your solution) Submission will be done through gradescope.
  All homework assignments and Final assignments will be open notes & open books. The final assignment will intend to challenge students by testing their implementation against time constraints.
- Final assignment: can be considered as a larger cumulative version of the homework assignments. It will be released early in the quarter and you will have 5-6 weeks to work on it.
- Interactive grading: is a opportunity to gain some points through 1:1 question and answer session with the instructor. Expect to set aside 20 mintes.
- Extra Credit: will come in the form of particiapation various forms.
- To pass the course students will need to attain at least 70 points.
