### Assessment and Grading

<div class="table-wrapper" markdown="block">

|       Catagory       | Points |
| :------------------: | :----: |
| Homework Assignments |   60   |
|    Final Project     |   20   |
| Interactive Grading  |   20   |
|     Extra Credit     |   3    |

- To pass the course, students will need to attain at least 70 points.
</div>

#### Homework assignments

These will be a mixture of theory questions along with coding questions worth 10 points each (6 \* 10 = 60 points). Coding questions will be non-trivial and will be tested against pre-determined test cases. Submissions will be done through gradescope. You can expect to get around 10 days to work on each assignment.

#### Final Project

The final project will be similar to the homework assignments but a bit more challenging and would encompass all the three sections of the class, namely Competitive programming, Approximation algorithms, and Randomized algorithms. The final project will be done in groups of 2 and it would be released during the first half of the quarter. You can expect to get around 5-6 weeks to work on the final project.

#### Interactive Grading

The interactive grading will be a crucial portion of the final grade. It aims at building the necessary communication and soft skills for industry interviews. It would take place during the last week of the quarter and would be based on the class content.

#### Extra Credit

Your participation in the class counts for extra credit. We really hope to make this class as beneficial as possible for everyone and thus, your participation, which would ultimately help in maintaining a strong learning environment, will be rewarded. The participation would come in various forms, including asking questions, filling feedback survey etc.
